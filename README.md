# CMPG 323 Overview - 34588353
Contains an overview of my plans and projects for CMPG 323 in 2022.

## Repositories
All Projects done will be managed underneath this repository:<br />
https://github.com/Drakensburg/CMPG-323-Overview---34588353

## Branching Strategy
A GitHub Flow branching strategy will be emplyed throughout the projects' development.<br />
The Following Guidelines Apply:<br />
[.]A Primary branch where all code will be branched off from. This is the Master Branch.  
[.]New Branches will be created for bugs and features.<br />
[.]When code is reviewed and approved it will be merged to the Master Branch and deployed to the Master Branch.<br />

## GitIgnore File
By ignoring certain files when commiting projects to GitHub Repositories, will alllow the protection of confidential information from being leaked.

## Sensitive Information and Credential Storage
Information containing anything of sensitive value will be stored only locally as online distribution would decrease confindentiality. Temp Files will fill their role for testing purposes when submitted to Main.
